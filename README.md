## Description

This repository houses all of the code for a real time camera validation system, commissioned by Collins Aerospace. The project is developed on two Raspberry Pi's connected via ethernet. The purpose of this system is to create a device capable of validating firmware processed video streams. The device accomplishes this by receiving two video channels, one channel is the raw data captured by the CMOS sensor of a camera, the second channel is the downstream, post-processed data output by the cameras firmware. The device intelligently analyzes and compares these two channels and detect in real time, image translation, frozen images, and blank video buffers.
